## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a variety of Java practice exercises and mini applications designed to strengthen your understanding of core Java concepts such as:

- Java basics (variables, operators, control statements)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Array manipulation and logic problems
- Console-based utilities and simple applications

This is ideal for beginners and intermediate learners preparing for interviews, self-learning, or refreshing fundamentals.
